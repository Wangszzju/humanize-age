API
----------------------------------------
### `getHumanizedAge(birthday, date)`

Returns string which represents the age in human-readable form.
For example, first method call in the example code above returns "3 months and 8 days old".

If s/he is younger than 1 month old, this method returns age in days (e.g.: "Day 14").

If s/he is younger than 1 year old, this method returns age in months (e.g.: "3 months old").

If s/he is younger than 15 year old, this method returns age in years and months (e.g.: "8 years and 3 months old").

If s/he is older than or equal to 15 year old, this method returns age in years (e.g.: "30 years old").

### `difference(d1, d2)`

Returns object which represents difference of specified two dates. `d1` must be smaller than or equal to `d2`.

For example, `humanizeAge.difference(new Date("1984-09-24"), new Date("2017-01-09"))` returns `{ y: 32, m: 3, d: 16 }`

### Note
Ages will be calculated assuming that specified dates are 00:00 in UTC.
